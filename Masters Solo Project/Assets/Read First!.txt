Which version to choose?

The pack contains versions for Desktop and Mobile platforms in Linear and Gamma color spaces.

1) Check your color space settings under Edit -> Project Settings -> Player -> Other Settings.

2) If you are using Linear color space, import the pack that matches your platform (Desktop or Mobile)

For example, if you are developing a PC project and your color space is Linear, then
"Eternal Temple PC Linear 1.5.unitypackage" is for you.

3) If your color space is Gamma and it is too late to swich to linear, import a linear package first,
and then import one of the "converters to gamma space".

For example, if you are developing a Mobile project in Gamma space, import
"Eternal Temple Mobile Linear 1.5" first, and then import "Convert Mobile Linear to Gamma 1.5"
on top of it.

4) Go to Assets -> Import Package -> Custom Package and select the one you want to import.

===================

Please make sure to backup your project before updating!

The pack is set up to work with the lightmap resolution of 8 and above.
